Scripts associated with the manuscript of Moulistanos et al. (domestication in gilthead seabream and European seabags)

The file "depth_simulation_analysis.py" is a Python script that estimates sample representation of a pool at a given sequencing depth.

The file "find_biallelic_SNP.py" is a Python script that finds biallelic SNPs in a bam-readcount v.1.0 outfile.

The Jupyter notebook, 'bottleneck_simulations.ipynb,' contains Python code for simulating recent bottlenecks in farmed populations of both species. These simulations were conducted to evaluate their impact on observed genotype frequency differences.
